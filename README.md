# Machine Learning Practice

## introduction ##

Some code about machine learning and deep learning. For practice and further thesis.   

## Content ##
 - Linear regression using gradient descent, and corresponding test code, test data.   

 - Locally weighted linear regression with test code and test data.   

 - Implement of sample back propagande neural network using pure pyhton which recognizes hand writting samples.    

 - Implement of sample neural network using Google tensorflow which recognizes hand writting samples.   

 - Implement of Convolutional Neural Network which labels CIFAR10 pictures with 80% accuracy.

## Dependencies ##

 - Python 3.x   
 - Numpy   
 - Matplotlib   
 - Tensorflow
