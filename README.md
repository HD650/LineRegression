# Machine Learning Practice

## introduction ##

Some code about data mining and machine learning. For practice and further use.   

## Content ##

 - Locally weighted linear regression with test code and test data.   
 - Linear regression using gradient descent, and corresponding test code, test data.   
 - Implement of sample neural network. (no test data and test code yet)   

## Dependencies ##

 - Python 3.x   
 - Numpy   
 - Matplotlib   

## Reference ##

This practice refers to lots of materials on web and on book.
