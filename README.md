、# Machine Learning Practice

## introduction ##

Some code about data mining and machine learning. For practice and further use.   

## Code Content ##

 - Linear Regression:   
 1.Implement of batch gradient decrease   
 2.Implement of locally weighted linear regression   
 3.Test data for linear regression   
 4.Graphic representation of test data and the regression line, which emphasize the different between two linear regression algorithm      
 - BP Neural Network：   
 1.Implement of a BP neural network to identify hand writing number      
 2.Script to unpack training picture from mnist data set which is compressed and unreadable to human    
 3.Script to train network and save the training result   
 4.Script to identity hand writing samples out of mnist    

## Dependencies ##

 - Python 3.x   
 - Numpy   
 - Matplotlib   
 - Pillow
