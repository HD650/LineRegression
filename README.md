# Machine Learning Practice

## introduction ##

Some code about data mining and machine learning. For practice and further use.   

## Content ##
 - Linear regression using gradient descent, and corresponding test code, test data.   

 - Locally weighted linear regression with test code and test data.   

 - Implement of sample back propagande neural network which recognize hand writting samples.    

 - Implement of sample neural network using Google tensorflow which recognize hand writting samples.   

## Dependencies ##
